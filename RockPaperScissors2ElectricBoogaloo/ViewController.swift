 For this project, we're following the Model-View-Controller design structure, which is as follows:
 - Model: sets up the data structures for our game. Swift doesn't know what Rock Paper Scissors is, so we need to define it by telling Swift how we can play the game (i.e. the Sign choices) and what outcomes we can get (win/lose/draw)
 - View: sets up the layout / design of the screen. We'll add some labels and buttons to our storyboard and connect it to our ViewController.swift file
 - Controller (not to be confused with the view controller!): sets up the logic of the game. This connects the Model and View together (i.e. if we click the Rock button in our view, we should play the game with our choice as Rock and the screen should update accordingly)
 */

/* Since we're creating new Types to model our game, it usually makes sense to create them in separate files: that way, we can maintain the individual parts of our data structure and use them together in this file. */
